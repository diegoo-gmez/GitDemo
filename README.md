# GitDemo
Simple repo to test out the Git functionality

### First steps
We need to clone the repo. Go ahead and colone it!

#### What is Git?
Is a Version Control Software used for keeping track of the project/code changes

#### What is GitHub?
It's just a server that hosts the git repo online so all developers can work on it.

### Frequent commands
* `git status`: Show the current status of the workspace.
* `git diff`: Show the changes from the last commit to the current workspace modifications.
* `git add <FILES>`: Stage files to be included in the next commit.
* `git commit -m "<Commit Message>"`: Generate a commit from the current changes.
        The **Commit Message** should be short and descriptive.
* `git log --all --graph`: Show the current commits and branches.
* `git push`: Upload your changes to GitHub.
* `git checkout <BranchName>`: Change the current working branch to "BranchName".
* `git checkout -b <BranchName>`: Create "BranchName" branch and change the current working branch to it.
